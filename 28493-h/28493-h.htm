A NIGHTCAP LETTER FROM
AUNT FANNY.</h2>

<p class="noi"><i>You dear little darling</i>:</p>

<p>A long time ago, that is,
long for such a little speck of a
child as you, just before last
Christmas, I wrote a story book
called "Nightcaps." I called it
this funny name, because poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
little lame Charley to whom all
the stories were told, called
them his "nightcaps," as he and
his sisters and brothers had to
go to bed, the moment a story
was finished for the evening.</p>

<p>Did you read them? I am
afraid they were <i>too old</i> for you,
you dear little kitten!</p>

<p>But since last Christmas, I
have heard some of the funniest
little bits of stories! funny
enough to make all the dimples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in your round face come out, or
rather come <i>in</i>, and cause you
to look perfectly lovely: for the
happy laughing face of a little
child, is the loveliest sight in
the world; and if <i>I</i> should see
those dimples, do you know
what I would do? why I would
just catch you up in my arms,
and give you a good kissing.</p>

<p>Then I have heard other little
stories, that are sad; because
you know in this world we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
always have perfect happiness:
things will sometimes
happen to grieve even a tender
little child; but although your
sweet lip may tremble as mine
does when I am writing, or
listening to a sad story, you
will not love me less, I hope,
because I have told the truth;
for remember, every thing is
true in this little book, and all
the dear little boys and girls
are living at this very moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
What would you say if you
knew some of them? Wouldn't
it be funny if you should exclaim,
while your mamma was
reading:</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, <i>I</i> know Lily;
why that's the very Lily that
lives next door:" or, "Oh,
mamma! stop! look here! that
very Willy goes to my school,
he's got a kite as big as any
thing! and he said he would let
me fly it, as soon as kite time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
came. <i>Won't</i> he stare, when I
tell him he's in a book? I wish
Aunt Fanny knew <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>You precious pet! Just
ask Mr. Appleton to tell you
where I live, then come with
a hop, skip, and jump to my
house, and you and I will have
a nice little talk, and after that,
take care! you will find yourself
in my next "Nightcap
book." Won't that be funny?</p>

<p>I have a little daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
named Alice; once upon a time
she gave away all the clothes
she had on to a poor little shivering
child, without any clothes,
only old rags. You see, Alice
felt so sorry for her; she had
plenty of clothes in her drawer,
but she did not think of those,
she just took off all she had on.
She is a dear "little Alice," and
I call her by a great many pet
names; sometimes she is "my
rosebud," sometimes I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"Come here, Mrs. Frizzlefits."
When she is sick, it is always
"darling," and when she is well
and hopping about, it is "you
precious little old toad." But
they all mean the same thing.
She likes to be my "old toad"
just as much as my "rosebud,"
for she knows perfectly well,
that they all mean <span class="smcap">love</span>.</p>

<p>One day, when I felt as if I
could not find a word to express
how much I loved her, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
came out with, "Come and kiss
me, you dear little <i>donkey</i>!"
How she laughed! and how I
laughed! You may be sure
she told her papa the moment
he came home, that now she
was a dear little donkey, as
well as a precious old toad.
Does your mamma ever call
you funny names? I hope so.</p>

<p>I will tell you how I came to
hear these stories. Lame Charley
has a sister, that last year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was about as large as a pretty
large doll. I suppose you know
how large I mean. She pattered
about on her cunning little
feet all day long; she only
sat down long enough to eat
her bread and milk; and so
when the sun went to bed, and
the chickens went to bed, and
the little birds said chip! chip!
to each other, meaning "good
night," Minnie (that was her
name) would begin to poke her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
fingers in her blue eyes, and say,
"Pease mamma <i>cake</i> Minnie:
Minnie <i>so</i> tired." Then her
mamma would lift her tenderly
into her lap and say, "Poor little
kitten! <i>so</i> tired:" and she
would unfasten her clothes
quickly, and slip on her little
night-dress, and then she would
kiss her four or five times to
waken her, and say, "Come,
darling, kneel in mamma's lap
and say your little prayer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Then Minnie would smile and
tumble about in a funny way,
till she got on her knees, and
then she would fold her hands
and say, "God bess my dear
mamma and papa, my bedders
and sisters, and poor lame Charley,
my dear bedder; God bess
me, and make me a good little
chile, for Jesus' sake, Amen."</p>

<p>What a sweet little prayer
that was! After the prayer
her mamma would kiss her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
again, and lay her gently in her
pretty crib; and before you
could count one! two! three!
Minnie was fast asleep.</p>

<p>But one evening lame Charley
had crept sooner than usual into
his mamma's lap, and was resting
his head against her kind
breast, and all his brothers and
sisters had come out of the corners
and closets, and from under
the tables and chairs, and
were chuckling and laughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and saying, "Hush! take seats
everybody! mamma is going to
tell us something real nice to-night,"
when little Minnie, (who
I forgot to tell you, always went
to bed before the story began;
because she was such a little
bit of a thing, and did not know
how to sit still and listen,) little
Minnie, all of a sudden trotted
up to her mamma, and taking
hold of Charley's leg, began
pulling it and crying, "Get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
down bedder, get down 'ight
away; let me tome, I want a
night<i>cat</i> too, 'cause I's old
now."</p>

<p>"Why, Minnie!" said her
mamma, "don't pull poor Charley;
if you are so old you can
sit in Charley's arm-chair, and
let him stay here; can't you?"</p>

<p>The honor of sitting in Charley's
arm-chair was something
to be proud of; so Minnie
climbed into it, and turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
round, with a little sideways
tumble into the seat, her eyes
sparkling with delight; then,
when she had twitched herself
straight, and had settled her
feet and elbows quite to her
mind, her mamma made this
little speech:</p>

<p>"Dear Charley, and all my
children, I meant to have told
you a story to-night, about a
lady who went to teach in a
ragged school. This is a school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
where poor little children are
washed and fed and taught;
who have scarcely any clothes
to wear; sometimes no shoes
or stockings; and are so very,
very poor and dirty, that they
cannot go to any other school.
Minnie is so young, she will not
understand it all. Now, shall I
tell a <i>baby story</i> <a name="quote" id="quote"></a><ins title="original omitted closing quotation mark">instead?"</ins></p>

<p>"Oh, yes! yes! yes!" shouted
all the good brothers and
sisters, "let Minnie have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
nightcap, or a 'night<i>cat</i>' as she
calls it; dear little darling! isn't
she a darling, mamma?"</p>

<p>"And what do you say, my
Charley?"</p>

<p>He lifted his curling head,
and put up his sweet pale lips
for a kiss, and said: "Dear
mamma, I love Minnie dearly;
I love all my brothers and sisters
more than I can tell; I
think a little baby story will be
<i>lovely</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>Then what happened? I
only wish you had been there
to see all the children rush up
to Charley, when he stopped
speaking. Such a kissing, and
laughing, and tumbling over
each other! I should think
Minnie was called a "darling,"
about fifty times; and Charley
a "darling," about a hundred;
because he was sick and lame,
you know, and <i>of course</i> ought
to be loved about twice as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
as anybody else, to make up
for it; and their mamma was
hugged till her daycap was all
pulled over one eye, with the
lace border resting on the end
of her nose, which made her
look so funny, that the children
laughed till some of them tumbled
down again; so what with
the daycaps, nightcaps and madcaps
of children, it was quite
a capital party. It took a long
time for them to settle down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
again; a great many little short
laughs had to be got rid of, and
the dimples would hardly go
away.</p>

<p>But at last they all sat quiet,
and the baby story began. It
was so interesting, that you
might almost have thought
the children had forgotten to
breathe, or wink their eyes,
they were so still.</p>

<p>When it was ended, Minnie
kissed her mamma, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"I very much 'bliged; I love
you five dollars, and Charley
five dollars," and then she bade
them all good night, and went
skipping and singing to bed,
her dear little face all smiles
and dimples.</p>

<p>After this, one of these little
stories was told every evening;
then, if there was time, after
Minnie pattered off to bed, her
mother would tell another to
the older children; but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
little nightcaps I have put in
this book, by themselves, on
purpose for you, you sweet little
thing! If you cannot read,
and I am almost sure you are
too young, you must ask your
mamma, or some one that loves
you, <i>very politely</i>, (<i>don't forget
that</i>,) to read them to you; because
these nightcaps are for
the inside of your cunning little
head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>And now, just here, on the
paper is a kiss from your

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_TOLD_TO_MINNIE" id="THE_STORY_TOLD_TO_MINNIE"></a>THE STORY TOLD TO MINNIE.</h2>

<p>I know a little boy, named
Johnny. He is a fat, rosy little
fellow, as round as a dumpling.
He has two large black eyes,
two small pink ears, two sweet
red lips, and only one little
white nose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, what a pity!" said
Minnie.</p>

<p>How the children did laugh,
when they heard little Minnie
sigh, and say this; but their
mamma kindly continued. Put
your hand up to your face,
Minnie, or look in the glass,
and you will find that Johnny
had just as many noses as you.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," said Minnie,
with a merry little laugh: "tell
more mamma."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>I suppose you use your two
bright eyes, to look at every
thing with. So did Johnny.</p>

<p>When he was quite a little
baby, his eyes sometimes got
him into trouble; if he saw a
pin, or a button, or little bit of
thread on the carpet, he would
creep up to it as well as he
could, pick it up with a good
deal of trouble, because his
fingers were so fat, and he did
not know very well how to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
them; and pop! it would go
right into his mouth.</p>

<p>You see, he had been here
in this world such a very little
while, that he thought every
thing in the world was made to
eat. Sometimes he would try
to eat his own toes; and once
he got the end of his nurse's
nose in his mouth, and gave it
a good nip with his two little
white teeth; and was very
angry, and cried very loud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
because she pulled it away. He
was only a baby you know.
Such a dear little fellow.</p>

<p>Johnny liked, of all things, to
be put in his little bath-tub,
half full of water. The moment
he saw the bath-tub, he
would begin to jump and crow
and laugh, and when he was
undressed, and lifted up to be
put in, his little feet would kick
in the air, as if he meant to
jump over the moon! When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he was in the water, Oh! then
was the time for fun! such
a splashing and dashing and
thrashing as the water got!
Such a noise! you could hear
him squealing with delight all
over the house, and very often
every body in the house would
come up to look at him; even
the cross old cook. She was
never cross to Johnny; she
would come in the room, and
opening her eyes would exclaim:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
"My Sirs! if Johnny don't look
just like the gold Koopid,
straddling over the top of the
looking glass in the parlor."
He did look like a little fat
Cupid. Any picture of a little
fat Cupid will show you how
Johnny looked when he was a
baby.</p>

<p>When Johnny was almost a
year old, his mamma and papa
took him to church to be christened.
Do you know what that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
means? It means that they
would promise before all the
people in church, and what is a
great deal more solemn, before
God, our Father in Heaven, to
do their best to make little
Johnny a good child, to teach
him to love, fear, and serve
Him all the days of his life.
They would give their dear
child to God.</p>

<p>When the time came for
them to go to the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Johnny had clasped tight in
his fat fingers, a little wooden
horse, about half as long as
Minnie's arm, with only one leg,
and a very short stump of a tail.
The little fellow had managed
to break off the long tail and
three legs, but <i>he</i> didn't care,
not he! one leg was enough for
him; he loved the horse dearly,
and sucked his head very often
and banged it against the floor,
and kissed it and took it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
bed with him every night, and
plunged it, sometimes head-first,
sometimes tail-first, into his cup
of milk every day, so that the
old horse had a very nice time.</p>

<p>When they tried to take it
away from him, Johnny began
to cry as loud as he could. He
was only a baby you know, and
did not know that an old broken
wooden horse ought not to go
to church, so he puckered up
his face in such a dismal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
manner, that his mamma thought it
best to let him keep it; and he
carried it to church in a state
of perfect delight, sucking the
head all the way.</p>

<p>When Johnny's mamma and
papa stood up with him before
the minister, what do you think
happened? Something surprising!
for he let his nurse take
the old horse out of his hand
and never missed it. He kept
perfectly still.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>The truth is, that he was
wondering very much what in
the world the good minister
had on the top of his nose. It
shone like a looking-glass every
time he turned his head. The
fact is, that it was a pair of gold
spectacles, and as none of
Johnny's family wore spectacles,
the minister's face astonished
him very much indeed,
and he stared at him with all
his eyes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>And now I shall have to tell
you what Johnny did with his
little fat fingers, when the kind
minister took him tenderly in
his arms, to christen him. You
know I must tell the truth.
He did not cry; he was not the
least mite afraid, because the
good minister smiled, and a
baby knows very well what a
kind smile means; he just put
up those little fat fingers, and
in a moment! he had twitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the spectacles off of the minister's
nose, and began to suck
them.</p>

<p>The good minister smiled,
and the people smiled, and
Johnny <i>laughed loud in church</i>.
He was such a little baby, you
know, he did not know he must
not laugh in church, and he was
so delighted with his new play-thing,
that the minister let him
keep the spectacles, and as he
put the water on his face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
gave him to God, Johnny did
not cry; oh no! he <i>smiled</i>;
and all the people in the church
looked with loving eyes on the
innocent child.</p>

<p>As the minister handed
Johnny back to his mamma,
he bent down his kind face and
kissed him, and said: "I hope
your dear little boy will live
and be a comfort to you. I
have a sweet little boy too, but
he is not here. God is taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
care of him for me." Do you
know what he meant? He
meant, that his dear little boy
was dead, and had gone to heaven
to live with Jesus, the Son
of God, who loves little children
so dearly.</p>

<p>Johnny soon gave up the
spectacles, when he caught
sight of his dear old horse,
with one leg and no tail; such
a darling as that old thing was!
and he showed his joy at getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
him back, by sucking his
head all the way home; once in
a while trying to poke it into
his nurse's mouth to give her a
taste.</p>

<p>The nurse had a straw hat
on, and Johnny, in his desire to
get at her mouth, pulled the hat
as hard as he could, and tore it
nearly in two pieces. He did
not mean to, you know; but
when he had done it he thought
it a very funny caper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
laughed, and put his hand
through the rent, and snatched
the comb out of her hair, laughing
all the time and jumping
almost out of her arms. What
a baby!</p>

<p>The poor nurse looked as if
she had been in the wars; she
did not get angry, she loved
Johnny so much; she only
held fast with one hand to
her ragged old hat, and hurried
home, laughing as hard as
Johnny.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>Let me tell you that the
old horse and the baby had
a fine supper that night, and
went to bed hugging each
other, that is, Johnny hugged
the horse.</p>

<p>Soon his beautiful black eyes
were closed in sleep, and his
little fat fingers, that had done
so much mischief without meaning
any wrong, were resting
quietly on his breast.</p>

<p>Those bright eyes and busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fingers wanted rest, don't you
think so? I do. So; good night,
little Johnny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

LILLIE'S SAYINGS AND DOINGS;<br /><br />

<span style="font-size: 50%">OR,</span><br /><br />

<span style="font-size: 70%">THE EFFECTS OF A GOOD EXAMPLE.</span></h2>

<p>Of all the precious, bright-eyed
fairies I ever knew, little
Lillie was one of the very first
and foremost. She was always
doing or saying something
charming or funny; and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>times,
<i>of course</i>, she was mischievous;
but if you were ever
so much provoked at her mischief
and its effects, <i>one</i> look at
her sweet, innocent face, so unconscious
of wrong meaning,
with the long golden curls
floating round it, <i>one</i> look, and
the great frown on your brow
would soften into a little one;
<i>another</i> look at the dimpled
cheeks, and imploring blue
eyes, and the little frown would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
disappear entirely; but when
the sweet voice said, "Mamma,
shall I put myself in the corner?
I <i>ought</i> to go," why, one, two,
three, presto!! all the angry
feelings would come right out
of your heart, and fly away up
the chimney! and a very good
riddance they were!</p>

<p>Don't you wish, little reader,
that angry feelings of all sorts
and sizes against everybody,
would adopt the fashion of flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
up the chimney, and never
come back again? I do.</p>

<p>Lillie was five years old.
She had two sisters older than
herself. One had already gone
"home," and was now a little
white-robed angel in heaven,
safe forever in Jesus' arms,
from the temptations and dangers
of this sorrowful life. The
other was a dark-haired, dark-eyed
little maiden, five years
older than Lillie, and the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
dignity of all these years caused
Annie to be impressed with a
lively sense of the great necessity
that rested upon her, of
setting a good example to her
sister, and brother Willie, a
curly headed little fellow, not
quite three years of age. I
will tell you how Annie came
to feel this responsibility so
deeply.</p>

<p>One day her mother asked
her to go down stairs, and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
a book that she wanted; but
Annie was very busy with her
paper dolls, and she answered
in a low voice, for she hardly
meant her mother to hear her,
"I shan't do it." When, what
was her amazement and sorrow,
to hear her little Lillie say,
right after her, "Mamma, if
you tell <i>me</i>, I <i>sant</i> do it, too."</p>

<p>Oh! my dear little reader,
this was worse than the most
dreadful punishment to Annie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to think that she had been so
naughty, and that her example
had caused Lillie to be naughty
too, and her heart sank, as she
looked up and saw her kind
mother sitting there, the great
tears falling one by one upon
her clasped hands, and her sorrowful
eyes fixed upon
her children.</p>

<p>With a grieved cry, Annie
rushed to her mother and threw
her arms around her neck, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
kissed her, and wiped the tears
away, and said, "Hush! hush!
dear mother. Oh! do stop crying!
and I will never, never do
so again," and little Lillie, who
was only three years old then,
and hardly knew how wrong
she had acted, in her desire to
imitate her sister, in everything,
clung to her mother and said,
"What for you <i>ki</i>, mamma?
don't <i>ki</i>," and so it came to
pass that Annie never forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
this terrible lesson, but strove
with all her might to set her
sister and brother a good example,
and begged her good and
pious mother to make a little
prayer for her, that she might
be strengthened from above.</p>

<p>This is the prayer her mother
made, which Annie said every
night and morning, with her
other prayers, and Aunt Fanny
who is writing this, begs you,
dear little readers, to learn this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
prayer; if you only say it <i>from
your heart</i>, I know it will help
you.</p>

<p>"O God, my Heavenly Father,
send thy Holy Spirit to
help me to be good myself, and
to set a good example to others.
Take all the wicked disobedient
thoughts out of my heart. Make
me a comfort and a joy to my
dear parents, and prepare me
to live with Thee and my dear
little sister now in Heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
For Jesus, my Saviour's sake,
Amen."</p>

<p>You have no idea how good
and lovely Annie became after
this. God answered her prayer.</p>

<p>In the summer time Lillie
and the rest would go into the
country to see her grandfather,
of whom she was very fond,
and well she might be, for he
was one of the best and dearest
grandfathers in the whole world.
He was a gentleman of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
school, and treated even children
with a stately courtesy;
but while, at the same time, the
children nestled to him with
the most fearless confidence and
love, they would as soon have
thought of cutting their heads
off, as of giving him one disrespectful
word or look.</p>

<p>In the very next house to
Lillie's grandfather's, lived "little
Alice," about whom you have
heard in "Nightcaps."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Alice always knew when
Lillie had arrived. Every
sweet summer morning Alice
would jump out of bed, and her
mother would throw the window
open, letting in the delicious
perfume from the strawberry
bed next door, and the
joyous <i>morning hymns</i> of the
little birds, and then, if Lillie
had come all at once, 'midst the
songs of the birds, a small clear
musical voice would be heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
singing (for she made a little
song of it)&mdash;"Al&mdash;<i>lie</i>! Al&mdash;<i>lie</i>!"
Then Alice would give
a jump, and answer, imitating
her song, "What&mdash;<i>ee</i>! What&mdash;<i>ee</i>!"
and then the bird outside
would sing, "Where's <i>you</i>?
Where's <i>you</i>?" and Alice would
answer, "Here's I, Here's I!"
and that would finish the duet,
for Alice would run to the window,
and there, just below,
would be Lillie, standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
daisy-spangled grass-plot, looking,
in her white dress and
golden curls under that blue
sky, fairer and lovelier far, than
any lily ever looked, in any
earthly gardener's conservatory.
It is true, that God made them
both, but this Lillie was a flower
blooming for immortality,
while the others would perish
in one short summer.</p>

<p>Then Alice would run down
stairs, and out of the house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
scramble through a little hole
in the fence at the back of the
house, and rush up to Lillie,
and Lillie would rush up to
Alice, and they would knock
each other down, without meaning
to, on the soft grass, and
roll over together, and jump up
again, as good as new, and
laugh! you never heard any
thing sweeter! and report themselves
ready for any play that
Annie might propose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>Lillie was very fond of singing.
She could sing most delightfully,
"Old Dog Tray," "I
want to be an Angel," "Pop
goes the Weasel," and many
other beautiful airs. She had
taught Willie to sing "Pop&mdash;go&mdash;a&mdash;dee&mdash;sell,"
as he called it,
and was unwearied in her efforts
to amuse him, for he was
a delicate little fellow, and had
been sick a great deal. In this,
Lillie was imitating her sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Annie, (do you see the importance
of a good example?) and
it was perfectly beautiful to observe
the care she took of him:
she would tie the bib round his
neck, when he was to eat his
dinner, so tight, as almost to
choke him to death, but with
the most loving intentions, and
would comb his soft curls down
on his face, and nearly scratch
his eyes out with the comb, but
Willie never cried; not he!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
because he knew perfectly well,
baby as he was, from the sweet
affectionate expression beaming
from Lillie's blue eyes, that she
did it all in love, and it is really
amazing what a deal of knocking
about, children will stand
and laugh at, if they know it to
be done in love or play, when a
slight touch in punishment will
set them crying.</p>

<p>One pleasant morning, just
before last Christmas, Lillie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
conversing with Willie while
they were eating their breakfast
with the family; for Willie had
been promoted to the dignity
of a high chair, and had commenced
the business of feeding
himself, and did it very well,
considering. About once in
five times he would stick the
spoonful of hominy in the middle
of his cheek, or on the tip
of his chin, expecting to find an
extra mouth or two, I suppose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
so that in a little while his face
would be ornamented with a
variety of white patches, which
made Lillie laugh, and Willie
laugh back; so upon the whole
he fed himself in what might be
called an <i>entertaining manner</i>,
and began to grow fat upon it.</p>

<p>Lillie was older, and of course
ate her breakfast like a dainty
little maiden, as she was, in the
neatest possible way, but for all
that, she liked plenty to eat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
presently she held out her plate
for some more cakes.</p>

<p>"Why, Lillie!" said her father,
pretending to be astonished,
"more cakes? you're just
like Oliver! I am sure you
must be full up to here," and he
pointed to his throat.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, papa, you are mistaken,
only look here, how loose
my skin is," and she grasped
the skin of her white neck,
and pulled it up, and cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
"see papa, quite a big room
left."</p>

<p>Her father laughed, and gave
her the cakes, and while she
was enjoying them, she cried to
Willie:</p>

<p>"I'm learning to spell and
read, Mr. Willie."</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> you?" answered Willie,
"why for?" and in his earnest
attention to this announcement,
he forgot the way to his mouth
again, and landed a spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of hominy on the end of his
nose.</p>

<p>Lillie laughed, and polished
his nose with her napkin; and
rubbed it so hard, that it made
Willie wink, and said:</p>

<p>"Because people must learn
to read and spell, and you must
learn too&mdash;I'm going to teach
you; come, spell 'cat.'"</p>

<p>"But I <i>tant</i>," said Willie.</p>

<p>"But you must," said Lillie,
"you must spell 'cat,' and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
must learn to read the Bible;
and you and I will read the
Bible every single morning, and
a great many times besides."</p>

<p>"Come, begin: spell 'cat.'"</p>

<p>Willie looked gravely down,
with very large eyes, at the cat,
as if he thought that she might
tell him; then lifted his mug,
on which was elegantly painted,
with about twenty-seven
flourishes, the words, "For
Willie," to his lips, and took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
long drink of milk, staring over
the top of it at the cat the
whole time, but the blinking
old tabby only dozed away
with one eye opened, and slapped
her tail on the carpet as if
to say, "you'll find no <i>spell</i> in
me," so Willie put his mug
down, and drawing a long
breath, lisped again, "But I
<i>tant</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lillie, a little
provoked, "if you can't spell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
'cat,' spell 'kitten:' that's <i>littler</i>."</p>

<p>This made a great laugh
round the table, and finally
Lillie had to teach Willie how
to spell this difficult word, and
she repeated the lesson so often,
and so kindly, that before an
hour, Willie could spell "cat"
just as well as Mr. Appleton
himself! think of that! and he
(Willie, not Mr. Appleton) was
so proud of his new accomplishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that he took an opportunity
to run away, and his nurse
went hunting after him, and
found that he had scrabbled
down the stairs backwards,
which was <i>his</i> way of getting
<i>down</i> in the world, (and I'm
sure it is better than plunging
headlong, as some people do,)
and trotted into the kitchen to
teach the cook and a little butcher
boy who had just brought
in the dinner, to spell "cat," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>asked her in return for this
kindness, to make him a "turnover
pie," which you may be
sure she did.</p>

<span class="caption">Willie teaching the Cook to spell Cat.</span>
</div>

<p>A few days after this, the
joyous Christmas came, the day
on which our blessed Saviour
was born, when everybody
ought to be grateful and joyful,
if they possibly can.</p>

<p>On this day, Annie, Lillie, and
Willie were in perfect ecstasies,
so many kisses, and so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
presents poured in upon them,
and all tokens of so much love;
<i>that</i> made the charm.</p>

<p>Lillie, especially, was enchanted
with two rings she received;
a pretty gold ring, and one of
red cornelian. Only think! the
grandeur and dignity of two
rings at once, on her little white
fingers! the very idea set her
singing and skipping with joy.
"Dear me," she said, "two wedding
rings! how delightful! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
shall begin a play 'mediately.
Come, Annie and Willie, let's
play I was a grand lady dressed
in two rings, coming to make
you a visit." Accordingly, Annie
spread herself out as wide
as she could, and Willie, as he
didn't happen to wear a hoop,
concluded to spread himself <i>up</i>
as high as he could, which he
effected by putting on a "sojer
cap" with a long feather, and
they sat up in state to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the company, and had a splendid
time, when the two rings,
and the lady, walked majestically
in.</p>

<p>The next day, a lady called
upon Lillie's mother, and said,
"How did Annie like the ring I
sent her?"</p>

<p>"Annie? <i>Lillie</i>, you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the lady, "I
sent the cornelian ring to Annie."</p>

<p>This announcement troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Lillie's mother. She knew her
little girl thought more of this
cornelian ring, than of all the
rest of her presents; but she
promised the lady, who was
their cousin, it should be given
to the rightful owner.</p>

<p>Now, this good mother would
gladly have bought another ring
for Annie, and let Lillie keep
her treasure, but that would
not have been the <i>right thing</i>;
so she took Lillie out walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with her, and as the little girl
skipped and danced along, (for
a little happy creature like that,
scarcely ever walks,) she began
her painful duty by saying,
"Lillie, what is the golden
rule?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know," said Lillie, "Do as
you would wish to be done
by."</p>

<p>"Well, do you understand
what it means?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, mamma; papa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
says the golden rule means,
that I must be good and kind
to everybody, because I always
want everybody to be good and
kind to me."</p>

<p>"Well, Lillie," said her mother,
in a very kind tone, "I must
tell you about a mistake I have
made. I am very, very sorry
for it. I gave you two rings
on Christmas day, and your
cousin tells me, that she meant
the cornelian ring for Annie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Now, Lillie, what will you
do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" exclaimed
Lillie, and then she stopped,
while a painful flush came all
over her face, her little breast
heaved, and her large and lovely
blue eyes filled with tears.
She felt very miserable, for a
moment, then checking a rising
sob, she said, softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma, you made <i>two</i>
'steaks. You said Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
day, that I had too many presents;
that was one 'steak, and
Annie had too few, that was
two 'steaks. I&mdash;I must give
this ring to sister Annie. It is
her ring. I shall only have <i>one</i>
ring, but, <i>never matter</i>," and
she sighed&mdash;&mdash;and <i>then she
smiled</i>.</p>

<p>"That is right, my darling,"
answered her mother, "that is
doing just as you would wish to
be done by."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>So Lillie, with her great resolution
filling her noble little
heart, said not a word more,
but hastened home with her
mother, and walked straight up
to Annie, with such a heaven-sent
smile illuminating her
sweet face, and took the precious
ring off her finger, and
said, "Here, Annie; this is your
ring, take it; it was meant for
you all the time, but mamma
didn't know it," and here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
rosy lips began to tremble, and
Lillie was silent.</p>

<p>"Would you <i>rather</i> I should
take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lillie.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will. If I had
got the two rings by mistake, I
should have given one to you
right away! indeed I would,
Lillie."</p>

<p>"Would you?" answered
Lillie, brightening wonderfully,
"well, then, I am glad I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>given it to you," and the painful
shadow passed away from
her face, and Willie was so impressed
with this interesting
scene, that he forthwith brought
out one of his dearest treasures,
a horse with a tail like a water-spout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
drawn for him by his
father, which he had painted
such a bright apple green, that
it set your very teeth on edge
only to look at it, and bestowed
it then and there upon Lillie,
with a hug and a kiss, that was
worth all the green horses, and
brown ones too, in the universe;
and thus happiness was restored
to the hearts of these three
lovely children, and Lillie got
along like other people, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
only one wedding ring, and
came to think it quite enough;
but that I believe is the general
opinion, though I am not absolutely
certain.</p>

<p>And now, if you little folks
cannot see by this story, the
good effects of setting a good
example, and how great the
responsibility even little children
incur in their relation to
each other, Aunt Fanny will
have a heart-ache, and she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
be brought to wish, that instead
of writing stories that do no
good, she had taken to growing
pumpkins or hard-hearted cabbages,
<i>and that's all</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JACK_AND_HIS_FRIENDS" id="JACK_AND_HIS_FRIENDS"></a>JACK AND HIS FRIENDS.</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, there was
a little boy, named Jack. He
lived in a house with his papa
and mamma, who were so fat
that they had to be very good-natured,
because you know, it
don't answer at all for fat people
to be cross, it makes them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
feel so very uncomfortable. So
it does everybody else, for the
matter of that! Who likes to
see any one cross or angry,
with a face flaming with rage,
and talking in so sharp a voice
that it sounds like a pack of
fire-crackers, going off? Why,
nobody. So, suppose you and
I try which can keep the brightest
and sweetest face all this
next year. Will you? you dear
little thing!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>Well, Jack had a pretty little
brown dog, named Carlo, and a
nice little white cat, named Minnie;
and Jack the boy, and Carlo
the dog, and Minnie the cat,
were the best friends, and had
the greatest fun together, that
ever a boy, and a cat, and a dog
had, since the world began, and
a little before.</p>

<p>When Jack had eaten his
pudding, and Carlo had munched
his bones, and Minnie had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
lapped her milk, they would all
rush out in the garden together,
as if they were distracted with
joy; and then such a hurrying,
and a scurrying, and a scampering,
and a scattering, and a cutting
round corners, and a hiding
under bushes, and a jumping
out of unexpected places, was
never seen or heard of, I do believe.
Wasn't it funny? Did
you ever have such fun?</p>

<p>One day, Jack's father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
mother had gone out to spend
the day with Mr. and Mrs.
Thingumbob, and the cook forgot
to give the poor little boy
his dinner.</p>

<p>Into the kitchen he rushed,
and nearly tumbled head first
into a tub full of soap-suds. If
he had, I couldn't have finished
this story, which would have
been a pity. But he did not
fall in; for he immediately
shouted out&mdash;"Mary! Mary!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Mary! I want a piece of bread
and butter! I want my dinner!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="422" height="600"
alt="You can&#39;t have any dinner, said the cook."
title="You can&#39;t have any dinner, said the cook." />
<span class="caption">You can&#39;t have any dinner, said the cook.</span>
</div>

<p>"But you can't have your
dinner yet," said the cook; "I'm
just making the dumpling; the
baker has not come, and there
isn't a speck of bread in the
house."</p>

<p>"Well, give me a piece of
cake then," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Haven't got any cake," said
the cook.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, candy then," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"Haven't got any candy,"
said the cook.</p>

<p>"Well, sugar, or sweetmeats,
or something; I'm just as hungry
as a little bear," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Haven't got 'em, Master
Jack," said the cook; "but I
tell you what! here is a penny;
go to the baker that lives on top
of the hill, and buy a loaf of
bread for yourself."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, yes! so I will!" shouted
Jack, jumping over a chair
and upsetting the knife-board,
and all the knives which the
cook had just been cleaning;
and this provoked her so, that
she caught up the broomstick,
and ran after him, and fell
over the wash-tub herself;
so Jack got off safe. Aren't
you glad?</p>

<p>Then he called Carlo, the dog,
and said&mdash;"Look here, Carlo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
do you want to go to the
baker's with me to buy a loaf
of bread?"</p>

<p>"Bow, wow, wow," said Carlo;
which meant, "Of course I
do. Hurrah!"</p>

<p>Then he called Minnie, the
cat, and said&mdash;"Look here, Minnie,
do you want to go to the
baker's with us to buy a loaf of
bread?"</p>

<p>Minnie opened her eyes, stiffened
her tail, and made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
back as round as a hoop, and
said, miau! miau! miau! which
was cat-talk for "Of course I
do. Hurrah!"</p>

<p>So they all started off together
in a state of perfect delight.
Presently, they came to where
Bunny the rabbit lived.</p>

<p>"Bunny, Bunny," called Jack.
Out popped little Bunny, flapping
his long ears, and winking
his red eyes, and gave a funny
little squeak; which meant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
"How-de-do, Jack, what do
you want?"</p>

<p>"Bunny," said Jack, "do
you want to go to the baker's
with us to buy a loaf of
bread?"</p>

<p>"Oh! of course I do," squeaked
Bunny. So Jack the boy,
and Carlo the dog, and Minnie
the cat, and Bunny the rabbit,
made quite a party.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they came to
Jenny Wren's house, high up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in a tree. "Jenny, Jenny," called
Jack.</p>

<p>Out she popped from her
nest, where she was sitting on
top of her children, and jumped
on a branch, and wagged her
little head, and fluttered her
little wings, and cocked up her
little tail in the air, to show how
glad she was to see her friend
Jack.</p>

<p>"Jenny," said Jack, "do you
want to go to the baker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
with us to buy a loaf of
bread?"</p>

<p>"Chip, chip, chip," said Jenny;
which was bird-talk for
"Oh! of course I do."</p>

<p>"Well, come along, then,"
said Jack. Down flew Jenny,
and hopped along with the rest.
So Jack the boy, and Carlo the
dog, and Minnie the cat, and
Bunny the rabbit, and Jenny
the wren, made a jolly little
party, all going to the baker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
together. I wish I had been
there, don't you?</p>

<p>Pretty soon they came to
where Ninny the goose lived.
"Ninny, Ninny," called Jack;
"do you want to go to the
baker's with us to buy a loaf
of bread?"</p>

<p>"Gabble, gabble, gabble," said
Ninny; which was goose-talk
for "Oh! of course I do;" and
she flapped her wings, and
stretched out her long neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and made more of a goose of
herself than ever, and was so
glad at getting the invitation,
that she created quite a hullabaloo
with her gabbling; but
for all that, Jack the boy, and
Carlo the dog, and Minnie the
cat, and Bunny the rabbit, and
Jenny the wren, and Ninny
the goose, all talking together,
made a most enchanting party.
They were all nice people; no
owls, or tigers, or cross old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
cooks with broomsticks, or grisly
bears. No, indeed! They
were all perfect darlings; and
were quite ready to travel
to the very top of the North
Pole, if there was any fun to be
found there.</p>

<p>But the baker lived considerably
this side of the North Pole,
on the very top of a steep hill;
and up they all ran, and hopped,
and leaped, and jumped,
till they got to the house.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>But when they arrived there,
they found the front door
locked.</p>

<p>So Jack began to knock, and
Carlo began to bark, and Minnie
began to mew, and Bunny
began to squeak, and Jenny began
to chip, and Ninny began
to gabble; but for all the
knocking, and barking, and
mewing, and squeaking, and
chipping, and gabbling, nobody
came to the door; and poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
little Jack began to think he
would never get his loaf of
bread after all.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, Jack thought
of the back door. Off they hopped,
and ran, and leaped, and
jumped, to the back of the
house.</p>

<p>The hill went down on this
side perfectly straight, like the
side of a house, and there
was scarcely room for them <a name="to" id="to"></a><ins title="original had tp">to</ins>
stand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>Dear me! that door was locked
too. So they each began
again to knock, and bark, and
mew, and squeak, and chirp,
and gabble, as hard as ever
they could; all crowding round
the door in a bunch.</p>

<p>Just as they were making all
the noise they could, suddenly&mdash;open
flew the door! and out
jumped a <span class="smcap">tremendous</span> DOG!!!
right into the middle of them,
<a name="growling" id="growling"></a><ins title="original had caowling">growling</ins>, and barking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
making his great white teeth
snap together like a pistol
shot!!</p>

<p>Frightened to death, Jack
tumbled backwards over Carlo;
Carlo tumbled backwards over
Minnie; Minnie tumbled backwards
over Bunny; Bunny tumbled
backwards over Jenny;
Jenny tumbled backwards over
Ninny; and they all tumbled
head over heels down the steep
hill, with the <span class="smcap">tremendous</span> DOG<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
on top of the heap; and that's
the last I ever heard of them.</p>

<p>"Oh! aren't you sorry?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LITTLE_HELEN" id="LITTLE_HELEN"></a>LITTLE HELEN.</h2>

<p>One day last spring when
Aunt Fanny was in Charleston,
she was walking up Meeting
Street. Just before her she
saw a pretty little girl, almost
as white as snow, carried in the
arms of a tall black woman,
nearly as black as ink.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>Aunt Fanny went softly up
behind them, and heard the old
nurse say&mdash;"You make nurse
shame, for carry such a big
girl."</p>

<p>"But I so tired," said the
little thing. "O my!"</p>

<p>"How much you tired?" said
the old black nurse.</p>

<p>"I tired a dollar," said the
child.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Fanny laughed,
and went up to her, and said&mdash;"Get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>down my little kitten, and
walk with me."</p>

<p>So the nurse put her down,
and she took hold of Aunt
Fanny's finger, and trotted
along, quite pleased.</p>

<p>"What is your name little
one?" said Aunt Fanny.</p>

<p>"My name Helen, and I'm
mamma's dear little baby.
Here's my house; come in my
house, do, please?"</p>

<p>So she pulled Aunt Fanny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
in; and there at the side of the
house was a large yard, and
in it was such a lot of little
children! all playing soldiers
together; some were white;&mdash;they
were Helen's sisters and
little brother;&mdash;and some were
black; they were old nurse's
children; and they were having
such a nice time; and the last
little black boy was ringing the
dinner bell. Aunt Fanny was
glad enough to see them, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>she could not stay; so she
kissed Helen, her little new
friend, and went away down
the street, and that's the whole
of this story&mdash;there!</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_LITTLE_SUSIE_WAS_LOST" id="HOW_LITTLE_SUSIE_WAS_LOST"></a>
HOW LITTLE SUSIE WAS LOST
AND FOUND.</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was
a little old gentleman, very old
indeed; his hair was as white
as snow, his eyes were dim, and
he had no more teeth than a
baby. As to his ears, they
were no use to him at all, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
he could not hear a single word
that was said. You might have
fired off twenty cannons close
to him, and he would not start
half as much as when some one
comes behind you, and says&mdash;Boo!!!</p>

<p>What a pity! because he was
such a kind, little old gentleman.
If he saw a little child
like you, he would smile, and
put his hand in his pocket, and
take out a piece of candy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
say&mdash;"Do you love candy?"
then the child would say&mdash;just
what you would say, if anybody
should ask you&mdash;<i>you</i> know.
Then the little old gentleman
would say&mdash;"I can't hear you,
but I know you love it, so here
is a famous piece for you."</p>

<p>One day the little old gentleman
thought he would take a
walk; so he put his hat on his
head, his great coat on his back,
his spectacles on his nose, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
his cane in his right hand, and
off he went.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="350" height="350"
alt="Little Old Gentleman" title="Little Old Gentleman" />
</div>

<p>It was a bright, cold day in
spring; the little birds were
very busy building their nests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
but he could not hear them
chirping to each other so sweetly.
Indeed, he could hardly
see them. Poor little old gentleman!</p>

<p>As he was walking quietly
along, he felt something very
soft take hold of his hand, and
grasp it tight. What do you
think it was? He looked down,
and there walking by his side,
and holding his hand, was a
tiny little girl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>She was looking up in his
face, with her sweet blue eyes;
her little bonnet had fallen
back, and the fresh wind was
blowing her pretty curls all
about.</p>

<p>"My name is Susy," said the
little girl; "please take me
home; mamma will say&mdash;'Where
is little Susy?'"</p>

<p>"I can't hear a word you
say," answered the little old
gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, then, take me home
'ight away," said Susy; "<i>mamma</i>
can hear what I say. Please
take me home, <i>grandpa</i>."</p>

<p>The dear little thing called
him "Grandpa," because she
thought all old gentlemen must
be grandfathers.</p>

<p>"I can't hear a word, my
poor child; I am deaf. Oh
dear! what is it she wants?
she must be lost," said the poor
little old gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, I am lost," said the
child; "and mamma wants
Susy. She can't do without
me. Papa, too. I'm his little
mouse. I bring him his
slippers when he comes home,
and I sing to him about 'Three
little kittens, lost their mittens.'
Come, grandpa, take
Susy home; ah, <i>do</i>;" and she
looked up into his face with
a sweet, coaxing smile, and
clasped his hand tighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
with her soft and pretty
fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" said
the little old gentleman, "if I
only could hear! But I can't!
I am deaf."</p>

<p>So they walked along quite a
distance, through the green
lane, where the tender grass
looked so dewy and fresh, and
the first spring violets were
peeping up; but no one came
in sight, and the little old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
gentleman in his trouble, looked
north, south, east and west, for
somebody to come that could
hear what the little one
said.</p>

<p>All at once he thought, I will
ask God to help me; and he
said aloud, in a voice trembling
with age&mdash;"Oh, my Heavenly
Father! help me to find assistance
for this tender little lamb."</p>

<p>When Susy heard him say
that, her rosy lip began to tremble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and a great tear came into
each of her blue eyes. Poor
little darling! she knew something
was wrong, but she did
not understand why he could
not hear her. She could hear
<i>him</i>, and she did not know what
it meant, to be deaf.</p>

<p>But now, as if in answer to
the prayer, a carriage was seen
approaching; and the little old
gentleman said&mdash;"Don't cry,
my little one; here, eat this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
candy, and don't cry. I will
get you home safely."</p>

<p>As the carriage came near,
he saw that there were two
ladies inside, and he held up
his hand and beckoned them to
stop. One of them was a kind-looking
lady, with soft gray
hair; and he said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, I am deaf. I cannot
hear a single word. I was
taking a walk, when this little
child came up and put her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
into mine. I think she is lost;
but I cannot hear what she
says. Will you take her with
you, and restore her to her
home?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will, poor little
darling," said the kind lady;
and the door was opened, and
Susy tenderly lifted in, and
placed on the lady's lap.</p>

<p>The little old gentleman kissed
Susy, and thanked the ladies;
then taking off his hat, he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
them a low bow, and then they
drove away.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where you
live?" said the lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I live with mamma
and papa," said Susy, "and my
kitty, and my doll; we all live
together."</p>

<p>The lady smiled, and said&mdash;"Well,
dear, we'll try to find
them." So they rode on a little
way, and soon came where
the houses were nearer each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
other. Susy looked out of the
carriage window, and did not
cry any more; because she
thought she would very soon
see her dear mamma.</p>

<p>Suddenly she screamed&mdash;"Mamma!
mamma! here is
Susy." Sure enough! there
was a lady hurrying along;
looking in every direction. As
soon as she heard Susy, her
face lost its troubled expression,
and she ran to the carriage door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and opened it, caught her little
child, and hugged her to her
breast, and said&mdash;"Oh, my darling!
my darling! Thank God
you are safe!" and then she
burst into tears&mdash;tears of joy
and gratitude.</p>

<p>The kind ladies told her how
Susy had strayed away into the
green lane; and how the little
deaf old gentleman had given
her to them to take home;
and Susy's mother thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
them again, and again; and
carried her precious child
home.</p>

<p>What a kissing Susy got that
evening from her father! and
how glad he was that his little
girl was there to bring him his
slippers! They did not get
angry with her&mdash;of course not!
Dear me! who ever heard of
such a thing? She did not
<i>mean</i> to do wrong; she had
just wandered off, singing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
little song, and talking to herself,
and picking the pretty
butter-cups that grew in the
grass; and when she looked
up, she could not see her
home; she only saw the little
old gentleman that she called
"Grandpa."</p>

little Susy was very glad to
do, for she had no idea of
losing her dear parents. No,
indeed.</p>

<p>But after that, she saw the
little deaf old gentleman very
often; and he grew to love little
Susy dearly; and though
they did not talk to each other,
they smiled; and he always had
something in his pocket for her.
Guess what it was? Candy?
Yes, that was the very thing.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
